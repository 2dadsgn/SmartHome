# Smart Home
<h3>What's the purpose of it?</h3>
The goal of this app is to create an automation app capable of connecting to any arduino board equipped with bluetooth HC-06.
Through the main page you can create your own rooms and control them, through the seekbar or the on/off buttons.
In my case I can control two step-motors connected to a curtain, so i can lift it.

<h3>How's realized?</h3>
It's realized in kotlin for the user's side (android app), and in C++ for the arduino's side.
