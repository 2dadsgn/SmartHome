# Smart Home
<h3>What's the purpose of it?</h3>
My goal was to create an automation app capable of connecting to any arduino board equipped with bluetooth HC-06 and using a communication's standard.
Through the main page you can create your specify your own device and control them, through the seekbar or the on/off buttons or through many more views.
In my case I can control two step-motors connected to a curtain, so i can lift it up or down.

<h3>How's realized?</h3>
It's realized in kotlin for the user's side (android app), and in C++ for the arduino's side.
