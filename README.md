# Smart Home
<h3>How it works</h3>
The project has the purpose to bring an automation app capable of connecting to any arduino board equipped with bluetooth HC-05 by using a standard communication.
It's possible to manage different rooms (in which the arduino is placed), there are some widgets like switches and seekbars for any kinf of purpose.
The app automatically detect what kind of data is sent by the arduino and put it in the right widget for the user interaction.


<h3>How's realized?</h3>
It's realized in kotlin for the user's side (android app), and in C++ for the arduino's side.
